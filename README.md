# Currency Exchange API â€“ NodeJS

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 u1ih/nodejs-api

curl -i http://localhost:8080/fx

CI/CD pipeline implemented using GitHub Actions:

- create docker container
- push to gcr.io container registry
- deploy to Google Cloud Run (knative / PaaS)

The CI/CD build workflow needs documentation. For now, here is how you connect it to GCP: [https://gcp-examquestions.com/ci-cd-solutions-deploy-to-google-cloud-run-using-github-actions/](https://gcp-examquestions.com/ci-cd-solutions-deploy-to-google-cloud-run-using-github-actions/)

In order for this to be provisioned on your Google Cloud instance, you need to make sure you create/update these GitHub secrets:

- GCP_APPLICATION
- GCP_CREDENTIALS
- GCP_EMAIL
- GCP_PROJECT

You'll also need to activate a couple of APIs in Google Cloud, the first deployment will probably fail and point you into the right direction. Alternatively, you could deploy the first version manually.
